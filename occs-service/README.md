# Deploying a Ruby Docker image to Oracle Container Cloud Service #

## Before You Begin ##

This tutorial shows you how to create an Oracle Container Cloud Service instance, and deploy a sample Ruby Docker image as a Docker container. 

Time to complete: **10 minutes**.

### Background ###

Use Oracle Container Cloud Service to deploy a Ruby Docker image.

### What Do You Need ###

* [An Oracle Cloud subscription](https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/container) that includes Oracle Container Cloud Service.

## Create a Service Instance in Oracle Container Cloud Service ##

1. In a web browser, go to https://cloud.oracle.com/home, and click **Sign In**.
2. From the **Cloud Account** drop-down list, select your data center, and then click **My Services**.
3. Enter your identity domain, and then click **Go**.
4. Enter your cloud account credentials, and then click **Sign In**.
5. If Oracle Container Cloud Service isn't listed on the dashboard, click **Customize Dashboard**.
6. Under **IaaS**, find **Container**, click **Show**, and then close the **Customize Dashboard** page.

## Test Your Deployment ##

1. On the Container Console page, click **Deployments**, and then click the deployment name. The page opens and displays the **Containers** tab.
2. Click the container name, and then click **View Logs**. The description for this container says it runs for 10 minutes and prints `Hello world` to the terminal. The information that it prints is also displayed in the logs. Verify that the log contains several `Hello world` messages with a timestamp. 
3. After you verify the log, to stop the container, click **Deployments**, and then click **Stop**.
4. When the container stops running, click **Remove**.
