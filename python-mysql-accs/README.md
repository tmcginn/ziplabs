# Connect a Python Application to Oracle MySQL Cloud Service #

## Before You Begin ##
This 10-minute tutorial shows you how to deploy a Python application to Oracle Application Container Cloud Service and then integrate Oracle MySQL Cloud Service with your application.
                            
### Background ###
Oracle Application Container Cloud Service provides a lightweight infrastructure so that you can run Java, PHP, Node.js, Ruby, and Python applications in Oracle Cloud. 

### What Do You Need? ###

* Access to an instance of Oracle Application Container Cloud Service (Make a note of your account information: identity domain, user name, and password.)
* Access to an instance of Oracle MySQL Cloud Service. (See [Creating an Instance of Oracle MySQL Cloud Service](https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=44785:112:0::::P112_CONTENT_ID:19922).
* [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* The [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) package management system
* Python Employee application project [employee-python-app.zip](file:///C:/Users/tmcginn/Documents/GitHub/learning-library/ziplabs/python-mysql-accs/files/employee-python-app.zip)
* [cURL 7.0+](http://curl.haxx.se/download.html) with SSL support

## Download the Project Dependencies ##
1. Extract the contents of the employee-python-app.zip file in your local system.
2. Open a command-line window (or terminal in Linux) and go to the employee-python-app directory.
3. Install the project dependencies.

   `pip install -r requirements.txt -t modules`
4. Create the python-service-dist.zip file with the content of the employee-python-app directory. Make sure that the zip file doesn't contain any subdirectories and all the files are at the root of the zip file.

## Deploy Your Application to Oracle Application Container Cloud Service ##
1. In a web browser, go to https://cloud.oracle.com/home and click Sign In.
2. From the Cloud Account drop-down menu, select Traditional Cloud Account, then select your data center, and click My Services.
3. Enter your identity domain and click Go.
4. Enter your cloud account credentials and click Sign In.
5. In the Oracle Cloud My Services dashboard, click Action menu and select Oracle Application Container Cloud Service.
6. In the Applications list view, click Create Application.
7. In the Create Application dialog box, click Python.
8. In the Application section, enter EmployeeService for the name of your application. Click Browse next to Archive.
9. In the File Upload dialog box, select python-service-dist.zip and click Open.
10. Keep the default values in the Topology section and click Create. Processing takes a few minutes.

## Add the MySQLCS Service Binding ##
1. Wait until the application is created.
2. Click the Deployments tab. In the Service Binding section, click Add.

4. In the Deployments dialog box, click Apply Edits.
5. Wait until the application is restarted and then copy the URL of your application. You'll use it in the next section.

## Test Your Application ##
1. Open a command-line window (or terminal in Linux).
2. Create the EMPLOYEE table. Replace the app_endpoint placeholder with the URL

   <code>curl -X GET -i <strong>app_endpoint</strong>/employees/setupdb</code>

3. Create an employee. 
   
   <code>curl -X POST -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"firstName\":\"Luis\",\"lastName\":\"Gray\",\"email\":\"john.gray@example.com\",\"phone\":\"1203123\",\"birthDate\":\"1975-05-14\",\"title\":\"Developer Manager\",\"dept\":\"IT\"}" <strong>app_endpoint</strong>/employees</code>

4. Get all employees.

   <code>curl -X GET -i <strong>app_endpoint</strong>/employees</code>

5. Delete the employee.

   <code>curl -X DELETE -i <strong>app_endpoint</strong>/employees/1</code>

6. Get the employee by ID.

   <code>curl -X GET -i <strong>app_endpoint</strong>/employees/1</code>
